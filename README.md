# orgmaster-dhe
A program to analyze org format files.

## Introduction
This is a personal project that aims to allow the analysis of org files used for notetaking.

The fundamental object in the program is an OrgEntry, which contains the notes taken on a particular day.  
The hope is that the program will allow the rapid analysis and organization of notes stored by date.

Eventually, I hope to add keyword and other functionality to the program.

This program is licensed under the __MIT license__.
